\section{Code improvements}

\subsection{Support for slanted small caps in the EC-fonts }
Since some time \LaTeX{} supports the combination of the shapes
small caps and italic/slanted. The EC-fonts contain slanted small caps fonts
but using them required the loading of an external package. Suitable font definitions
have now been added to \pkg{t1cmd.fd} and so from now on
\begin{verbatim}
 \textsc{\textsl{slanted small}}
 \textsc{\textit{italic small caps}}
 \bfseries
 \textsc{\textsl{bold slanted small caps}}
 \textsc{\textit{bold italic small caps}}
\end{verbatim}
will give the expected result: {\fontfamily{cmr}
\textsc{\textsl{slanted small}} \textsc{\textit{italic small caps}}
\bfseries
\textsc{\textsl{bold slanted small caps}} \textsc{\textit{bold italic small caps}}}
%
\githubissue{782}


\subsection{EC sans serif at small sizes}

The EC (T1 encoded Computer Modern) sans serif fonts have errors at
small sizes: the medium weight is bolder and wider than the bold
extended. This makes them unusable at these small sizes. The default
\texttt{.fd} file has therefore been adjusted to use a scaled down 8pt
font instead.

\githubissue{879}

\subsection{Auto-detecting key--value arguments}

To allow extension of the core \LaTeX{} syntax, \pkg{ltcmd} now supports
a \texttt{={...}} modifier when grabbing arguments. This modifier instructs
\LaTeX{} that the argument should be passed to the underlying code as
a set of keyvals. If the argument does not \enquote{look like} a set
of keyvals, it will be converted into a single key--value pair, with
the argument to \texttt{=} specifying the name of that key. For
example, the \cs{caption} command could be defined as
\begin{verbatim}
  \DeclareDocumentCommand\caption{s ={TOC-text}+O{#3} +m}
\end{verbatim}
which would mean that if the optional argument does \emph{not}
contain keyval data, it will be converted to a single keyval
pair with the key name \texttt{TOC-text}.

Arguments which begin with \texttt{=,} are always interpreted as
keyvals even if they do not contain further \texttt{=} signs.
Any \texttt{=} signs within math mode are ignored, meaning that
only \texttt{=} outside of math mode will generally cause
interpretation as keyval material.

\section{Changes to packages in the \pkg{graphics} category}

\subsection{Fix a \cs{mathcolor} bug}

The \cs{mathcolor} command intorduced in \cite{36:ltnews35} needs to
scan for following sub and superscripts, but if it did so at the end
of an alignment cell, e.g., in a \texttt{array} environment, the
\texttt{\&} was evaluated too early causing some internal errors. This
is now properly guarded for.
